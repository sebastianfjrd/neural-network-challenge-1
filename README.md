18th Challenge - Loan Repayment
Our company, specializing in student loan refinancing, has developed a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan repayment by borrowers. Utilizing a dataset containing information on past student loan recipients, we employed machine learning and neural network techniques to build this model, enhancing our ability to offer accurate interest rates and personalized loan options.

Data Collection
We gathered comprehensive data on each student, including:

Academic Records: GPA and test scores to assess academic performance.
Loan History: Previous loan amounts and repayment records to evaluate financial reliability.
Financial Aid: Scholarships and grants received to understand current financial support.
Employment and Income: Job status and income levels to gauge repayment capability.
Demographic Information: Age, gender, and family situation for additional context.
Course Details: Study major and expected graduation date to predict future earnings.
Financial Literacy: Participation in financial literacy workshops to measure financial management skills.
Model and Methodology
Using content-based filtering, we personalized loan recommendations based on the unique attributes of each student. This approach considered factors such as academic performance, financial status, and employment information to suggest the most suitable loan options. We successfully created a neural network model with the following steps:

Data Preparation: Cleaned and scaled the data.
Model Creation: Built and compiled a neural network model.
Model Training: Trained the model using historical data.
Evaluation: Achieved satisfactory accuracy and loss metrics, validating the modelâ€™s effectiveness.
Prediction: Used the model to make predictions on new data, successfully identifying the likelihood of loan repayment.
Challenges and Considerations
Data Privacy and Security: Ensuring the protection of sensitive personal and financial information to maintain compliance with regulations and build trust with our clients.
Bias and Fairness: Implementing strategies to prevent bias and ensure fair loan recommendations for all students, regardless of their background or financial situation.
By addressing these challenges and leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, we have created a robust and equitable recommendation system. This system enhances our ability to offer tailored student loan options, ultimately improving customer satisfaction and financial outcomes.
